## Repository structure

- `example/` is filled with end-user applications built on the HoloREA framework.
	- `holorea-graphql-explorer/` is a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) interface to the system with some added [additions to assist with comprehension](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer-example). Wired up to the development DNAs by default&mdash; super handy for testing and getting to know the ValueFlows [data structure](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-graphql/).
- [`happs/`](happs/README.md) contains subdirectories corresponding to separate Holochain app DNA packages, which expose their data as independent, isolated DHTs. Each DNA is composed of multiple *zomes* which describe semi-independent bits of functionality within that app DNA.
- `lib/` contains library code that is used by the various hApps (Holochain apps). Note that shared code is necessary to facilitate sharing of data between DHTs, as the de/serialisation logic is defined by Rust structs- hence this separation.
	- `hdk_graph_helpers/` is the result of abstracting away common functionality used in zome callback handlers to reduce boilerplate.
	- `vf_core/` contains core record structure types and type aliases for defining & linking records.
	- `vf_*/` the other folders in this directory correspond to the actual ValueFlows record structures and their behaviours, especially conversions.
- `modules/` is home to the JavaScript modules used in binding the Holochain backend to UIs, servers etc
	- `vf-graphql/` is the ValueFlows [reference spec](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-graphql/), used as the schema.
	- `vf-graphql-holochain/` contains the complete GraphQL schema adapter with bindings to Holochain DNA conductors (which expose the app DNAs defined in `happs/`).
- `test/` contains JavaScript integration tests for the system as a whole&mdash; they cover zome API tests and interactions between different app DHTs.
- `scripts/` just has utility script files used for DevOps tasks and configuring the repo.
- The NPM scripts in `package.json` at the top level of the repo are used to orchestrate test commands & run the apps for development. Please see the file for reference.
